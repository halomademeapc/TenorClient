# API Docs

These docs are automatically updated anytime a change is made to the `master` branch.  You can use these to explore how public parts of the code are linked together.  The XML comments used to generate this should also be present in [the NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TenorClient/) for hints while coding.
